    PL path length of node
    [C,CIN,COUT] = PL(G) calculates the path length C, in-path length CIN
    and out-path length COUT of all nodes in the graph G.
    
    The path length is the average shortest path lengths of one node to all
    other nodes. The path length of a node is the average of the in-path
    and out-path length of that node.
